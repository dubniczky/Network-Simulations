## Description

Networking simulations for educational purposes.

- `hash-dataserver` - A dataserver returning data based on it's hash. A user can add a new piece of data to the server storage, then request it later using it's hash. If the hash has no corresponding data in the storage an error is returned instead.
- `mininet` - A small mininet generated from configuration
- `netcopy-checksum` - The clients sends a message to the server, which forwards it to the checksum server for verification. The client can create and delete verified message blocks.
- `pingtrace` - Issue ping and tracert commands on a list of domains from a csv using sync or async methods.
- `pingtrace` - Simulation of reservations on a network using a network map and pre-defined capacities. Each node can reserve a slot or free their slot.
